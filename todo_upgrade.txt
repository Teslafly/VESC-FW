change
PAL_STM32_PUDR_PULLUP
to
PAL_STM32_PUPDR_PULLUP

- update makefile
- update chconf.h
- update update halconf.h
- update update mcuconf.h

move these files into mcu specific config? 
aka stm32f4 folder and include.
then can have stm32g4 or stm32f7/h7 configs too.



v2-
swap st stm32f4 drivers for hal drivers (at least uart, usb, can, spi, flash, etc interfaces)
